To define a stoch-species, you need only give its name and its molecular weight.  At this point in Moleculizer's development, stoch-species do not participate in automatic species and reaction generation, so that even the molecular weight is superfluous for now and is included only for consistency with other kinds of molecules.  Since stoch-species do not participate in automatic reaction generation, the only reactions at this time that can involve stoch-species are explicit-reactions.</doc><attribute name="name"><doc>The names of all explicit species must be distinct.</doc></attribute><ref name="optional-user-doc"></ref><element name="weight"><doc>Here, for consistency with other kinds of molecules' treatment, you give the molecular weight of the stoch-species.  Since stoch-species do not participate in automatic reaction generation, this molecular weight is not used at this time.</doc><attribute name="daltons"><doc user-variable="yes">This should be a positive, floating-point number like 12.3 or 4.56e-7.</doc></attribute><ref name="optional-user-doc"></ref></element><element name="default-diffusion-rate"><doc>Give the diffusion rate of the molecule.  This diffusion rate may be overridden for the boundaries between any selected compartments.  This can be a convenient way of confining a mol, along with all the complexes that contain it, in some region of the cell, say the nucleus and the cytoplasm.</doc><attribute name="value"><doc>Give diffusion rates in square meters per second.</doc></attribute><ref name="optional-user-doc"></ref></element><element name="default-compartment-pop"><doc>Give the population of the stoch-species that you wish to be present in most compartments at the beginning of the simulation.  You can override this population for any compartments you like using compartment-pop elements.  (You can use a create-event to add more of this species to any or all compartments at particular times in the course of simulation.)</doc><attribute name="count"><doc>This should be a non-negative integer.</doc></attribute><ref name="optional-user-doc"></ref></element><zeroOrMore><element name="compartment-pop"><doc>Use as many of these OPTIONAL elements to override the default population for any or all compartments.</doc><attribute name="compartment-name"><doc>Give the name of the compartment in which to override the default population.</doc></attribute><attribute name="count"><doc>This should be a non-negative integer.</doc></attribute><ref name="optional-user-doc"></ref></element></zeroOrMore><zeroOrMore><element name="boundary-rate"><doc>Use as many of these OPTIONAL elements as you need to override the normal diffusion rate for the boundaries between specified compartments.
