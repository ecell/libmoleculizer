Looks like I just did some minor revisions on the dr-optimize example.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To do wiki/web-related:

There are many elements and attributes in moleculizer and cpt whose
documentation needs attention, and they need to have user-doc elements added in
the schema, too.

I have proposed a web-app, tentatively named "rngLive".  Here, just a few
notes:

An "rngLive" would be a thing like a simple Wiki, a directory containing
a few perl scripts, a few XSLT transformations, and a subdirectory for versions
of the xml document.  If one does not need to keep a comment for each version,
then the versions could just be the very documents themselves, otherwise, each
version would have to be a directory containing document, comment, and
whatever.  There would be three perl scripts:

1. Display the back versions as links for access, along with their comments,
   in a simple, ordered list from newest to oldest.  Taking one of these links
   would invoke script 2 below.  Also display a simple
   button for uploading a new version, along with a comment field for the
   upload.

2. Display a particular xml file in an html form, showing each editable
   attribute's value in an edit box.  Only one action buttons: update, with an
   edit box for giving the reason for the edit.  Also a link for downloading
   the current version of the document, which would not be a cgi action.

3. The cgi script to do the edit.  It might emit the same html as 2,
   displaying the results of editing, and preparing for another edit.
   Another possibility would be to "return" to the main page.

------------------------------------------

Web server notes:

In /etc/apache2/default-server.conf, it appears that I configured a "wikis"
directory in my htdocs area (at /srv/www/htdocs on genome) to allow overrides
of permissions using a .htaccess file.

Then there is a file /srv/www/htdocs/wikis/.htaccess that appears to turn on
CGI execution for executables with the .cgi extension.  This seems to mean
that all these perl scripts will need .cgi extensions.

In /srv/www/htdocs/wikis/.htaccess, I also configured it to follow symlinks;
probably irrelevant to this project.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To do build-related:

Compartmentalizer does not have the timeout option, though it has some
provisions for it in code.  Doesn't seem to check timeout during simulation
cycle.  Can't tell at this moment whether it's just an omission or if there
was some complication.  Compartmentalizer does appear to do state dump.  There
are no compartmental versions of continuator or parametrizer, so I may have
omitted timeout because there would be nothing to do with the resulting state
dump.

Another detail realized while working with compartmentalizer (e.g. in
cpt-receptor10 versions) is that column headers associated with dump-streams
are not optionally settable.  This causes a problem when the default column
headers come out the same, as when dumping different compartments of the same
species in different dump streams.

The "tolerance" acceleration doesn't seem to be parsed from the command line;
don't know what happened to it.

Demos:

In some cases where a demo has more than one version, all the versions have
basically the same makefile, and these could be consolidated.

cpt-receptor10		4 versions; haven't run these through yet--too long.

cpt-receptor-sphere	7 versions; haven't run these through yet--too long.

cpt-uniMolPtase		Needs better commentary in html.

heinrich-odie,
heinrich-rk4tau,
heinrich-state		Why am I running parametrizer in these?
			Figure it out and explain it in the html file, or
			remove it.

heinrich-sbml		This doesn't add anything to the vanilla heinrich
			demo except for generation and pretty-printing of
			sbml file.  It should probably just be consolidated
			with the vanilla heinrich demo.

heinrich-state		This really seems to be a continuator demo.
			It also seems not to be working exactly right;
			populations in the state dump seem to be 0,
			incorrectly.  I note that they are all stoch-species.

omniPtase		
omniReceptor		Need html pages.

simple-extrap		Needs html page fix on link to plot.

simple-odie		Again, I'm running parametrizer, but I don't really
			remember why.

simple-sbml		Needs html page fix.

small-mol		Need html page.  Rename "simple-small-mol" ?

uniMolPtase		Need html page.


Add the wiki simulation as a demo?  It's really a version of omniReceptor;
perhaps the present omniReceptor demo should just be replaced with the new
version on the wiki?

Adding html translation of each demo input file, and link from each demo's html
page to the html translation of the associated input file(s).
Something along these lines might be good for state dumps, too, but I don't
have this set up.  The state dump schema is missing lots of documentation.

Add target to demos.mk to make all the demos.

Attend to overall demos html page.  Make sure that it's targeted by the
overall documentation and targets the top of the overall documentation.
