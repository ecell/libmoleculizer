      <element name='nucleotide-bind-gen'>
        <doc>This is a generator for typical nucleotide-binding and un-binding reactions, such as will bind or unbind ATP or ADP from a kinase.  These reactions will happen regardless of the complex in which the nucleotide-binding protein finds itself.</doc>

          <attribute name='rate-extrapolator'>
            <doc>You can use this optional attribute to remove the dependency of the rates of the generated reactions on reactant masses by selecting the "none" value.  If you do not attach the attribute, or you do so and select the "mass" value, then the default mass-based extrapolation will be used.</doc>
