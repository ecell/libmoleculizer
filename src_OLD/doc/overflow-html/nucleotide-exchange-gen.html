Being in this complex causes a conformational change in the G-protein that changes its nucleotide binding kinetics. In the alpha pathway, the enabling complex includes at least Gpa1, the alpha receptor Ste2, and alpha-factor itself; some of our models also include the G-beta component Ste4.</p><p>This model differs from the simpler gpa-exchange-gen, which swaps the nucleotides immediately.  Instead, the bound nucleotide must dissociate and the alternate nucleotide must bind in two separate steps.</p><p>You will need a separate nucleotide-exchange-gen for each of the nucleotides, in our case GTP and GDP.  The changes in binding kinetics for these two nucleotides should be complementary: in our case GDP should get a lower on-rate and higher off-rate when in the alpha-factor-bound receptor complex.  GTP should get a higher on-rate and lower off-rate when in the alpha-factor-bound receptor complex.</p><hr/></body></html>
