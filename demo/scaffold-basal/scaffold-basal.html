It runs to twice the simulation time of the activated pathway simulation.</p><p>Because it takes somewhat longer to run than the other demos, it and the "scaffold" simulations are in a separate make target; "make long" in the demo directory.</p><p>The demo is not a "success" because too much phosphorylation activity occurs in the kinase cascade without stimulus.  Balancing the sensitivity of the cascade so that it responds adequately when stimulated, but not too much when not stimulated, is a painstaking process.</p><hr></hr><p>The behavior of the receptor part of the simulation looks pretty much okay for basal response.</p><img alt="Demo not run yet." src="basal.out/four.png"></img><p>But the kinase cascade is not sufficiently damped to prevent gradual runaway of activation in the later stages.</p><img alt="Demo not run yet." src="basal.out/scaf.png"></img></body></html>
