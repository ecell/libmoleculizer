To define a stoch-species, you need only give its name and its molecular weight.  At this point in Moleculizer's development, stoch-species do not participate in automatic species and reaction generation, so that even the molecular weight is superfluous for now and is included only for consistency with other kinds of molecules.  Since stoch-species do not participate in automatic reaction generation, the only reactions at this time that can involve stoch-species are explicit-reactions.</doc><ref name="optional-user-doc"></ref><attribute name="name"><doc>The names of all explicit species must be distinct.</doc></attribute><element name="weight"><doc>Here, for consistency with other kinds of molecules' treatment, you give the molecular weight of the stoch-species.
