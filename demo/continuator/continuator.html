When a moleculizer simulation has a clock-time limit and it exceeds the limit, then it automatically dumps state into a file called timeout-state.xml.  Continuator will continue the simulation from the time-out point in this case, or from the point that state was dumped from a moleculizer simulation by the user with a "dump-state" event.</p><p>In this demo, a moleculizer simulation (a version of the alpha pathway receptor complex) runs until it times out, then continuator continues the simulation, again with a time limit just to make the demo brief.</p><hr></hr><a href="./source.html">simulation input</a><p>This plot gives an overview of the simulation up to the point where it times out;  my computer gets through 2.14 seconds of simulation time before the 15 second clock time limit expires.</p><img alt="Demo not run yet." src="moleculizer.out/four.png"></img><p>Here is the same plot, but with the simulation continued for another 15 seconds using continuator.  In the 15 seconds of further simulation, I get to simulation time about 2.33 seconds.</p><img alt="Demo not run yet." src="continuator.out/four.png"></img></body></html>
