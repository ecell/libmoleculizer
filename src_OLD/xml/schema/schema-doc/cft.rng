The generated reactions can change any one small-mol component of the omniplex into another small-mol, if desired.  The generated reactions can change the modification at any one modification site on any one mod-mol component of the omniplex, if desired.  The generated reactions can be binary, if desired, requiring any explicit reactant species as a co-reactant with the species that is recognized as containing the omniplex. The generated reactions can produce an arbitrary explicit product species, in addition to the transformed primary reactant, if desired.  Each of these separate activities on the part of the generated reactions is engaged simply by including the appropriate optional elements in this reaction generator specification.</doc><ref name="optional-user-doc"></ref><element name="enabling-omniplex"><doc>In this element, you specify a subcomplex which, if recognized in a new species of complex, will cause this reaction generator to make a reaction with the new species of complex as a substrate, possibly along with another substrate given explicitly.</doc><ref name="optional-user-doc"></ref><ref name="omni-plex-class"></ref></element><element name="small-mol-exchanges"><doc>This element may contain optional small-molecule-exchange elements to change one small-mol component of a complex for another small-mol.  So, if nucleotide binding is modeled using small-mols, this section could be used to arrange that, in a kinase reaction, an ATP small-mol component is exchanged for an ADP small-mol.  Hydrolysis of a bound small-mol representing a nucleotide is the same; it's the same as a kinase reaction, except that no phosphate modification is added.</doc><zeroOrMore><element name="small-mol-exchange"><doc>This OPTIONAL element lets you specify that a small-mol component of omniplex should be converted into another small-mol when the reaction occurs.  For a kinase, use this option to convert an ATP small-mol instance to ADP.
