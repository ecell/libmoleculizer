This figure shows the pattern in which the membrane is divided into patches:</p><center><img alt="compartments.png" src="compartments.png"></img></center><p>There are 16 membrane compartments: first, divide the sphere into octants, with four compartments in each hemisphere.  Now divide the compartments in both the north and south hemispheres in half by adding another "longitude" line. There are 16 cytoplasm compartments directly "beneath" and communicating with the corresponding membrane compartments.  At the center, there is a diffusive "core" that communicates with all 16 cytoplasm compartments.</p><p>No attempt was made to cause boundary areas or volumes to correspond to the illustrated physical dimensions, only the arrangement.  Boundaries between the cytoplasm compartments are all the same, and they are the same as those between the cytoplasm compartments and the center compartment.  Boundaries between membrane compartments are 0.1 times the area of the rest of the boundaries, corresponding to the notion that the membrane compartments are 0.1 times as "thick" as the membrane compartments.</p><p>(Actually, it's not entirely clear how to use the physical shapes of the compartments and their boundaries to set up the compartments and boundaries of the simulation.)</p><p>Ste5-Ste5 binding is generally enhanced in this simulation, relative to the previous (version3) simulation in which Ste5 oligomerization was enabled.  This seems to make oligomers longer lasting and more significant in the simulation.  In this simulation, corresponding binding sites on Ste5 can bind each other when either of the Ste5's are bound to Ste4.  The stronger binding that was present in version 3 when both of the Ste5 partners were Ste4-bound is now present when either of the Ste5 partners is Ste4-bound.</p><p>Non-corresponding sites on Ste5 still do not bind one another in this simulation.</p><p>Taken together, the above enhancement to Ste5-Ste5 binding seem to cause more oligomeric structures involving Ste5 to appear and for them to affect the simulation more noticeably.</p><hr></hr><p><a href="./source.html">simulation input</a></p><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/alpha.png"></img><p>Unfortunately, it's not obvious from this plot that all the alpha factor goes into compartment 0 at time 2.  It's also hard to see it in the .dmp file, now that the membrane compartments are more highly interconnected.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-total.png"></img><p>In this simulation, Ste5 dimerizes with itself well when either of the two Ste5's are bound to Ste4.  Now, because of Ste5 oligomerization, the total number of Ste5-containing molecules drops steadily after the addition of alpha factor: more Ste5's are contained in fewer (Ste5-oligomeric) molecules.</p><p>Compared to most of the cpt-receptor10 simulations, the diffusion rate of Ste5 has been set very low, to be able to monitor the movements of Ste5-Ste5 dimers in the membrane. (Though this is rather silly, as Gustavo pointed out.)</p><p>Also, like in the cpt-receptor10 simulations, the "core" compartment is not included in the "cytoplasm" traces, which accounts for the asymmetry here.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-total-membranes.png"></img><p>Ste5-containing molecules in the membrane compartments.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-five-membranes.png"></img><p>Ste5-dimer containing molecules in the membrane compartments.</p><p>In this simulation, corresponding binding sites on Ste5 can bind each other when either of the Ste5's are bound to Ste4.
