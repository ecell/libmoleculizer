Here, the compartments are actually fewer in number, but they are connected in a way consistent with 3-dimensional organization:</p><center><img alt="compartments.png" src="compartments.png"></img></center><p>There are 8 membrane compartments, arranged as the octants of 3-dimensional space, along with 8 cytoplasm compartments directly "beneath" the corresponding membrane compartments.  At the center, there is a diffusive "core" that communicates with all 8 cytoplasm compartments.</p><p>Aside from the difference in connectivity, compartments are as much like they were in the cpt-receptor10 simulations as possible:  membrane, cytoplasm and the "core" compartments are all the same sizes as before; the membrane compartments are 0.1 times the size cytplasm compartments, and the "core" is the same size as a cytoplasm compartment.  Boundaries between the compartments are all the same; no attempt was made to cause them to correspond to the illustrated physical dimensions, only the arrangement.</p><p>(Actually, it's not entirely clear how to use the physical shapes of the compartments and their boundaries to set up the compartments and boundaries of the simulation.)</p><hr></hr><p><a href="./source.html">simulation input</a></p><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/alpha.png"></img><p>Unfortunately, it's not obvious from this plot that all the alpha factor goes into compartment 0 at time 2.  It's also hard to see it in the .dmp file, now that the membrane compartments are more highly interconnected.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-total.png"></img><p> In this simulation, Ste5 can dimerize with itself when either of the two Ste5's are bound to Ste4.  Ste5-Ste5 binding is further enhanced when both of the Ste5's are bound to Ste4.</p><p>Compared to most of the cpt-receptor10 simulations, the diffusion rate of Ste5 has been set very low, to be able to monitor the movements of Ste5-Ste5 dimers in the membrane.  This probably accounts at least in part for the slower movement of Ste5 to the membrane seen here.</p><p>Also, like in the cpt-receptor10 simulations, the "core" compartment is not included in the "cytoplasm" traces, which accounts for part of the asymmetry here.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-total-membranes.png"></img><p>Ste5-containing molecules in the membrane compartments.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-five-membranes.png"></img><p>Ste5-dimer containing molecules in the membrane compartments.  In this simulation, Ste5 can bind Ste5 when either of the Ste5's are bound to Ste4.  An already-formed Ste5-Ste5 binding will break at a moderate rate as long as one of the partners remains bound to Ste4. When both partners in an existing Ste5-Ste5 dimer become unbound from Ste4, the Ste5-Ste5 binding breaks rapidly.  Ste5-Ste5 binding is faster when both partners are bound to Ste4, and unbinding is somewhat slower, than when only one of the partners is Ste4-bound.</p><p>In this simulation, the binding of Ste5 to Ste5 has been made quite strong, so that Ste5-Ste5 dimers are more persistent.   The diffusion rate of Ste5 has also been made quite low.  Combined, these changes should make it easier to "see" diffusion of Ste5-Ste5 dimers in the membrane.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-five-membranes-sec4-4.5.png"></img><p>Time detail of Ste5-dimer containing molecules in all membrane compartments.  </p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-five-membranes-sec4-4.5-cols.png"></img><p>Time detail of Ste5-dimer containing molecules in a couple of membrane compartments.  </p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-center.png"></img><p>Ste5-containing molecules in the central core.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/gpa1.png"></img><p>Gpa1 binding to GDP and GTP.</p></body></html>
