Thanks for downloading libmoleculizer.

You should just have to ./configure, make, make install this package
for it to work pretty easily.  

Libmoleculizer depends on the libxml++ library and Python, and is
pretty darn flexible as to how it gets it, such that for 99.9% of you
who just want to get this up and running, just ./configure, make, and
make install will work.

===  Troubleshooting =====

Libmoleculizer depends on two libraries to run - libxml++ and Python.

It will search for and use either libxml++-2.6 or libxml++-1.0, and
attempt to build and use libxml++-1.0 instead.  

If you are on a linux system, these packages are probably available
through your package manager - this is definitely true for Ubuntu and
Fedora.  If you decide to compile them from source, definitely use
libxml++-1.0, which depends only in turn on libxml2 (which is almost
certainly on your system, is guaranteed to be in your package manager,
and compiles from scratch).

Libmoleculizer also needs to find and link to Python.  This has been
tested and works out of the box on Fedora, Ubuntu, and Moc OSX.  If,
however, you have troubles, make sure Python is installed, and make
sure the build can find you Python.h header file and the libpython
library.
