The reason for mol-instances is that the same mol can appear more than once in a complex.  This approach gives each mol in the complex its own local "instance name," so that the binding pattern is easy to give, regardless of multiple occurrences of the same protein in a complex.  (The instance-name approach is borrowed from digital electronics, where components, like AND gates, can appear many many times in a design.

A typical example is that some binding site is occluded because of the overall configuration of the complex.
