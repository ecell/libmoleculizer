This simulation also uses the (correct?) structure of the receptor complex, in which Ste2 binds to Gpa1, instead of to Ste4.</p><p>The compartment structure looks like this:</p><img alt="compartment structure image" src="compartments.png"></img><hr></hr><p><a href="source.html">simulation input</a></p><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor10.out/alpha.png"></img><p>Unfortunately, it's not obvious from this plot that all the alpha factor goes into compartment 0 at time 2.  But the numerical dump file alpha.dmp does show this clearly.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor10.out/five-total.png"></img><p>Now, since Ste5 dimerizes itself, more of it is depleted from the cytoplasm, but we don't see a great increase in the number of Ste5-containing molecules in the membrane.  (The Ste5-containing molecules in the membrane tend to contain more Ste5.)  In this simulation, Ste5 can dimerize with itself when either of the two Ste5's are bound to Ste4.  Ste5-Ste5 binding is further enhanced when both of the Ste5's are bound to Ste4.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor10.out/five-total-membranes.png"></img><p>Ste5-containing molecules in the membrane compartments.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor10.out/five-five-membranes.png"></img><p>Ste5-dimer containing molecules in the membrane compartments.  In this simulation, Ste5 can bind Ste5 when either of the Ste5's are bound to Ste4.
An already-formed Ste5-Ste5 binding will break at a moderate rate as long as one of the partners remains bound to Ste4. When both partners in an existing Ste5-Ste5 dimer become unbound from Ste4, the Ste5-Ste5 binding breaks rapidly.  Ste5-Ste5 binding is faster when both partners are bound to Ste4, and unbinding is somewhat slower, than when only one of the partners is Ste4-bound.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor10.out/five-five-membranes-sec4-4.5.png"></img><p>Time detail of Ste5-dimer containing molecules in all membrane compartments.  </p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor10.out/five-five-membranes-sec4-4.5-cols.png"></img><p>Time detail of Ste5-dimer containing molecules in a couple of membrane compartments.  </p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor10.out/five-center.png"></img><p>Ste5-containing molecules in the central core.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor10.out/gpa1.png"></img><p>Gpa1 binding to GDP and GTP.</p></body></html>
