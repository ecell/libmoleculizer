/*! \defgroup plexGroup The plex unit.
\ingroup unitsGroup
\brief Provides complexes and subcomplexes.

This unit provides plexSpecies, which are species of protein
complexes, and plexFamily, the single parameterized species at this
point in development.  A plexFamily is a family of complexes that
all have the same structure; they are differentiated from one
another by the internal states of their mols.  A plexFamily is a
highly embellished STL map from (vectors of) mol states to precise
species of complex.

This unit also provides the recognizer.  This mechanism determines
the structural class of a complex constructed from scratch by a
reaction.  This is a fundamental part of the automatic manipulation
of new species of complexes.  Once the structure is determined,
the plexFamily for the complex is known.  The plexFamily is based
on an STL map from mol states to precise species of complex, and
a map lookup in this map is the final step in recognizing a species
of complex.

This unit gives the underpinning for selecting plex species for
dumping complexes or not based on the state of their constituent
mols.  Basic mols don't have any state, so that these underpinnings
don't get useful until you load a unit that defines an interesting
class of mols (e.g. phos) and queries to determine their interesting
states.  */
