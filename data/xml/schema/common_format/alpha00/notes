- Is there a way in relax ng to specify that certain data types must
  refer to a reference to something earlier in the doc? 

- We need to figure out how to specify using a parameter value within
  a math section in a parameter value section (one variable defined in
  terms of another).

- We need to figure out a good name for the root element.  (rules?)

- Do we need names as well as ids?

- Is there a consistant policy as to when to mandate empty subtags and
  when to not (ie should mol-state-changes be a mandatory subelement
  of transformation, even if it has no subelements?)

- In transformation, how should state changes be applied?  For
  creating or removing bingings, we are using ids, both for a simple
  way to specify as well as to enforce the condition that to make a
  binding both binding sites should be free/to break a binding, it
  must exist.

  However, to update a modification value or to changes the state of
  either a mol or a binding site, this seems overly restrictive.  It
  is well-defined to specify that a mol/binding site should end up
  with a particular state on the reactant side without a precondition
  on its initial state.
