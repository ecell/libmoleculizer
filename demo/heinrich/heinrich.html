This abstract pathway was the subject of the paper "Mathematical Models of Protein Kinase Signal Transduction," by Heinrich, Neel, and Rapoport.

The phosphatase works to dephosphorylate all the activated protein kinases.</p><img alt="Demo not run yet." src="heinrich.out/others.png"></img></body></html>
