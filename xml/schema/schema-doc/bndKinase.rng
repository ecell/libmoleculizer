Most of the other reaction generators are designed for modeling styles that represent nucleotide binding as a modifiction of the protein that binds the nucleotide.</doc><ref name="omni-plex-class"></ref><element name="substrate-mod-mol-instance-ref"><doc>Here, you point out the substrate mod-mol instance in the enabling sub-complex.</doc><attribute name="name"><doc>This must be the name of a mod-mol instance in the enabling complex.</doc></attribute><element name="phos-site-ref"><doc>Here, you tell which modification site on the substrate mod-mol represents the site to be phosphorylated.</doc><attribute name="name"><doc>This must be the name of a modification site on the substrate mod-mol.</doc></attribute></element></element><element name="phosphorylated-mod-ref"><doc>This is the name of the modification representing phosphorylation; when the reaction happens, this modification will be made at the substrate's phosphorylation site.  Any modification that is already present at the substrate's phosphorylation site will simply be discarded, so your enabling subcomplex's state specification should state that that the substrate is currently unphosphorylated (i.e. has modification "none," or whatever you prefer to call it.)</doc><attribute name="name"><doc>This must be the name of a modification.</doc></attribute></element><element name="atp-small-mol-instance-ref"><doc>Here, you give the instance name of the ATP mol in your enabling complex.  Moleculizer will check that this mol is really a small-mol, so that, in particular, it has one and only one binding site.  This makes it possible to replace it with the ADP small-mol that you specify.</doc><attribute name="name"><doc>This should be the instance name of a small-mol in your enabling complex.</doc></attribute></element><element name="adp-small-mol-ref"><doc>Here, you give the name of the small-mol representing ADP.  This small-mol will replace the small-mol that you point out as the instance of ATP in the enabling complex.</doc><attribute name="name"><doc>This must be the name of a mol.</doc></attribute></element><element name="rate"><doc>The reactions generated by this reaction generator are unary reactions on complexes containing the enabling sub-complex.
