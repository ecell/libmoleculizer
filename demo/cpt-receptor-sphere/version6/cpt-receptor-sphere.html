This figure shows the pattern in which the membrane is divided into patches:</p><center><img alt="compartments.png" src="compartments.png"></img></center><p>There are 16 membrane compartments: first, divide the sphere into octants, with four compartments in each hemisphere.  Now divide the compartments in both the north and south hemispheres in half by adding another "longitude" line. There are 16 cytoplasm compartments directly "beneath" and communicating with the corresponding membrane compartments.  At the center, there is a diffusive "core" that communicates with all 16 cytoplasm compartments.</p><p>The volumes of the cytoplasm and central compartments are all the same, and each membrane compartment is 0.1 times as large, part of arranging that the membrane compartments are "thin."</p><p>All of the boundaries between compartments have the same area, 1/16 of the surface area of the cell, with the exception of boundaries between membrane compartments, which have 0.1 times that area.  This is again because the membrane is "thin."</p><p>All of the distances between compartments are the same, 1/3 the diameter of the cell, except for the distances between membrane compartments and their underlying cytoplasm compartments, which are 0.5 times as large.  Again, this is because the membrane is (radially) "thin".</p><p>(Actually, it's not entirely clear how to use the physical shapes of the compartments and their boundaries to set up the compartments and boundaries of the simulation.)</p><p>Ste5 binding to itself, the setup for oligomerization, is the same in this simulation as in the previous version.</p><p>Populations are derived from K. Benjamin's early quantitative Western numbers by dividing them by the "mini-cell" factor.  Molecular weights are all from the database.  The setup calculations and units conversions are all done in a perl script, <a href="./mini-yeast.pl">mini-yeast.pl</a>, the output of which you see <a href="./mini-yeast.out">here.</a></p><hr></hr><h2>Changes</h2><p>This is the second run implementing the "mini-cell" concept: reducing the volume of the cell and its populations to the point that the membrane compartments are not usually so highly populated.  That goal, at least, seems to have been achieved.  In this simulation, we have reduced the cell's linear size by a factor of 2, and therefore reduced its volume by a factor of 8.</p><p>An item left undone was proportional reduction in the rates of binary reactions to compensate for the reduction in volume.  I think that some of the gross differences in this simulation may be due to this; in particular the way all of the Gpa1 gets dissociated from Ste4 and never gets back on.</p><p>The most radical number from the first mini-cell simulation, the very slow diffusion rate in the membrane, roughly 100 times slower than in the cytoplasm, was adjusted upward by a factor of 10, and what's going on in the membrane looks more reasonable now.  For example, alpha factor now diffuses out over the membrane instead of just sitting in one place.</p><p>Finally, I ran this simulation out to 32 sec. since things were looking okay qualitatively.  This is probably too slow overall, though, I'm guessing.</p><hr></hr><p><a href="./source.html">simulation input</a></p><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/alpha.png"></img><p>Alpha factor now diffuses over the membrane as it should.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/four-five-total.png"></img><p>Here we see Ste5 binding to Ste4 in the membrane.  Compare with <a href="#ste5-total">total Ste5</a> in the membrane.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/four.png"></img><p>This looks to me like a bad balance between the affinities of Gpa1 and Ste5 for Ste4.  I think it may be because I did not adjust binary reaction rates when I shrank the cell.  Compare with <a href="#gpa1">Gpa1-GDP</a> below</p><hr></hr><a name="ste5-total"></a><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-total.png"></img><p>Ste5 dimerization and oligomerization (that is, how Ste5 binds to itself via either of two binding sites) is set up the same as in the last simulation.</p><p>The "core" compartment is not included in the "cytoplasm" traces, which accounts for part of the asymmetry here.</p><p>But also note the drop in the number of molecules that contain Ste5 at all.  This means that there are plenty of molecules containing more than one Ste5.</p><p>I think that this general movement of Ste5 OUT of the membrane before the addition of alpha can be accounted for as equilibration.  Starting with a single molecule of Ste5 in each membrane compartment puts the membrane as a whole at slightly higher than average concentration.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-total-membranes.png"></img><p>Ste5-containing molecules in the membrane compartments.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-five-membranes.png"></img><p>Ste5-dimer containing molecules in the membrane compartments.</p><p>In this simulation, corresponding binding sites on Ste5 can bind each other when either of the Ste5's are bound to Ste4.  The stronger binding that was present in version 3 when both of the Ste5 partners were Ste4-bound is now present when either of the Ste5 partners is Ste4-bound.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-total-membranes-sec15-20.png"></img><p>Time detail of Ste5 containing molecules in all membrane compartments.  </p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-total-membranes-sec15-20-c2.png"></img><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-total-membranes-sec15-20-c4.png"></img><p>Time detail of Ste5 containing molecules in a couple of membrane compartments.  </p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-center.png"></img><p>Ste5-containing molecules in the central core.</p><hr></hr><a name="gpa1"></a><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/gpa1.png"></img><p>Gpa1 binding to GDP and GTP.</p><p>Again, I think this "maxing out" behavior may be due to my not adjusting binary reaction rates for the mini-cell shrinkage.</p></body></html>
