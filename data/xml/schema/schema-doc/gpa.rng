The nucleotide exchange generator and auto- and hetero-hydrolysis reaction generators provide what is hoped to be a more precise, although considerably more complex model of G-protein nucleotide exchange and the inverse hydrolysis reactions converting the bound GTP to GDP.</doc><ref name="plex-class"/><element name="target-mod-mol-instance-ref"><doc>Here, you say which protein in the "enabling complex" is actually the G-protein.  You do this by giving the instance name of the protein, which must be a mod-mol, since nucleotide bindings are modeled as modifications.  In the mod-site-ref element, you say which modification site on the mod-mol is involved.  Note that the G-protein (Gpa1) must already be bound to GDP (i.e. have the GDP-bound modification at the correct modification site) to be involved in this simplified form of nucleotide exchange.</doc><attribute name="name"><doc>This must be the instance name of an instance of a mod-mol, the mol representing the G-alpha protein.</doc></attribute><element name="mod-site-ref"><doc>Here, you give the name of the modification site on the G-protein where the modification representing nucleotide binding occurs.

This reaction fits into the same simplified picture of nucleotide exchange as gpa-exchange-gen: the bound GTP is replaced with GDP and phosphate is produced all in one step.
