This figure shows the pattern in which the membrane is divided into patches:</p><center><img alt="compartments.png" src="compartments.png"></img></center><p>There are 16 membrane compartments: first, divide the sphere into octants, with four compartments in each hemisphere.  Now divide the compartments in both the north and south hemispheres in half by adding another "longitude" line. There are 16 cytoplasm compartments directly "beneath" and communicating with the corresponding membrane compartments.  At the center, there is a diffusive "core" that communicates with all 16 cytoplasm compartments.</p><p>The volumes of the cytoplasm and central compartments are all the same, and each membrane compartment is 0.1 times as large, part of arranging that the membrane compartments are "thin."</p><p>All of the boundaries between compartments have the same area, 1/16 of the surface area of the cell, with the exception of boundaries between membrane compartments, which have 0.1 times that area.  This is again because the membrane is "thin."</p><p>All of the distances between compartments are the same, 1/3 the diameter of the cell, except for the distances between membrane compartments and their underlying cytoplasm compartments, which are 0.5 times as large.  Again, this is because the membrane is (radially) "thin".</p><p>(Actually, it's not entirely clear how to use the physical shapes of the compartments and their boundaries to set up the compartments and boundaries of the simulation.)</p><p>Ste5 binding to itself, the setup for oligomerization, is the same in this simulation as in the previous version.</p><p>Populations are derived from K. Benjamin's early quantitative Western numbers by dividing them by the "mini-cell" factor.  Molecular weights are all from the database.  The setup calculations and units conversions are all done in a perl script, <a href="./mini-yeast.pl">mini-yeast.pl</a>, the output of which you see <a href="./mini-yeast.out">here.</a></p><hr></hr><h2>Changes</h2><p>This is the third run implementing the "mini-cell" concept: reducing the volume of the cell and its populations to the point that the membrane compartments are not usually so highly populated.  That goal, at least, seems to have been achieved.  In this simulation, we have reduced the cell's linear size by a factor of 2, and therefore reduced its volume by a factor of 8.</p><p>In the last "mini-cell" simulation, it appeared that the factor of 8 reduction in volume produced a bad effect because I did not change the rates of binary reactions.  So, I've reduced binary reaction rates by a factor of 10 from the last mini-cell simulation.</p><hr></hr><p><a href="./source.html">simulation input</a></p><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/alpha.png"></img><p>Alpha factor now diffuses over the membrane as it should.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/four-five-total.png"></img><p>Here we see Ste5 binding to Ste4 in the membrane.  Compare with <a href="#ste5-total">total Ste5</a> in the membrane.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/four.png"></img><p>This looks better than in the last simulation; it doesn't just max out now.  Similarly for <a href="#gpa1">Gpa1-GDP</a> below</p><hr></hr><a name="ste5-total"></a><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-total.png"></img><p>Ste5 dimerization and oligomerization (that is, how Ste5 binds to itself via either of two binding sites) is set up the same as in the last simulation.</p><p>The "core" compartment is not included in the "cytoplasm" traces, which accounts for part of the asymmetry here.</p><p>But also note the drop in the number of molecules that contain Ste5 at all.  This means that there are plenty of molecules containing more than one Ste5.  The state dump at 7.9 sec. shows lots of oligomeric species, though many of them are "transients" that you would not expect to survive long and have population 0.  Dimeric species are populated at that time.</p><p>I think that this general movement of Ste5 OUT of the membrane before the addition of alpha can be accounted for as equilibration.  Starting with a single molecule of Ste5 in each membrane compartment puts the membrane as a whole at slightly higher than average concentration.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-total-membranes.png"></img><p>Ste5-containing molecules in the membrane compartments.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-five-membranes.png"></img><p>Ste5-dimer containing molecules in the membrane compartments.</p><p>In this simulation, corresponding binding sites on Ste5 can bind each other when either of the Ste5's are bound to Ste4.  The stronger binding that was present in version 3 when both of the Ste5 partners were Ste4-bound is now present when either of the Ste5 partners is Ste4-bound.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-total-membranes-sec15-20.png"></img><p>Time detail of Ste5 containing molecules in all membrane compartments.  </p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-total-membranes-sec15-20-c2.png"></img><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-total-membranes-sec15-20-c7.png"></img><p>Time detail of Ste5 containing molecules in a couple of membrane compartments.  </p><p>One might speculate that these "spikes" are from the transient decomposition of oligomeric species; essentially, a Ste5-containing piece breaks off an dimeric/oligomeric species, momentarily increasing the number of molecules containing Ste5, then either reattaches or diffuses away into the cytosol.</p><p>This is a situation where I would like to know the number of Ste5 mols in the compartment, in addition to the number of molecules that contain Ste5.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-center.png"></img><p>Ste5-containing molecules in the central core.</p><hr></hr><a name="gpa1"></a><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/gpa1.png"></img><p>Gpa1 binding to GDP and GTP.</p></body></html>
