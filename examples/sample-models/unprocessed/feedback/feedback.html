The original abstract pathway was the subject of the paper "Mathematical Models of Protein Kinase Signal Transduction," by Heinrich, Neel, and Rapoport.  Molecular Cell 9, 957-970,2002.  </p><a href="./source.html">simulation input</a><hr></hr><img alt="Demo not run yet." src="feedback.out/active-kinases.png"></img><p>This plot shows the activation of the kinase cascade.  In this "feedback" version, active-kin1 and active-kin2 are deactivated by active-kin3, in addition to (constant) deactivation by ptase-x.</p><hr></hr><img alt="Demo not run yet." src="feedback.out/others.png"></img><p>This plot shows the constant levels of active-receptor, along with the phosphatase ptase-x.  The phosphatase works to dephosphorylate all the activated protein kinases.  In this "feedback" version, active-kin3 also degrades active-kin1 and active-kin2.</p><hr></hr></body></html>
