This simplified form of nucleotide exchange happens only when the G-protein is in a particular enabling complex, which is supposed to change the physical conformation of the G-protein to reduce its affinity for GDP and increase its affinity for GTP.  In the alpha pathway, this enabling complex includes at least alpha factor, the trans-membrane receptor Ste2, and the G-alpha component Gpa1.  It also includes the G-beta component Ste4 in some of the receptor models we have used at MSI.</p><p>Technically, the G-protein in the "enabling" complex need not be restricted to be in the GDP-bound state, and this slightly simplifies the expression of the complex.  But reactions are generated only for species of the "enabling" complex in which the G-protein is GDP bound.</p><hr/></body></html>
