{\bt binding-site: }

{\bt binding-site shape: } See {\it shape}.

{\bt dimerization-gen: } 

{\bt feature: }

{\bt mod-mol: } This is the main type of mol in a libmoleculizer
model.  Mod-mols have names, a set of binding-sites, and a
collection of modification-sites.

{\bt modification: }
{\bt modification-site: }

{\bt mol: } The individual molecular unit that makes up a complex
species.  Mols in a libmoleculizer model may be either mod-mols or
small-mols.

{\bt omni-gen: }

{\bt omni-plex: } 

{\bt shape: } 

{\bt small-mol: }
