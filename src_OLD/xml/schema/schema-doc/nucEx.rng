You do this by giving the instance name of the protein, which must be a mod-mol, since nucleotide bindings are modeled as modifications.  In the mod-site-ref element, you say which modification site on the mod-mol is involved.  Note that the G-protein (Gpa1) need not be bound to GDP (i.e. have the GDP-bound modification at the correct modification site) to be involved in this form of nucleotide exchange.
