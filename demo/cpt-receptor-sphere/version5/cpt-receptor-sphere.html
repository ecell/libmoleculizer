This figure shows the pattern in which the membrane is divided into patches:</p><center><img alt="compartments.png" src="compartments.png"></img></center><p>There are 16 membrane compartments: first, divide the sphere into octants, with four compartments in each hemisphere.  Now divide the compartments in both the north and south hemispheres in half by adding another "longitude" line. There are 16 cytoplasm compartments directly "beneath" and communicating with the corresponding membrane compartments.  At the center, there is a diffusive "core" that communicates with all 16 cytoplasm compartments.</p><p>The volumes of the cytoplasm and central compartments are all the same, and each membrane compartment is 0.1 times as large, part of arranging that the membrane compartments are "thin."</p><p>All of the boundaries between compartments have the same area, 1/16 of the surface area of the cell, with the exception of boundaries between membrane compartments, which have 0.1 times that area.  This is again because the membrane is "thin."</p><p>All of the distances between compartments are the same, 1/3 the diameter of the cell, except for the distances between membrane compartments and their underlying cytoplasm compartments, which are 0.5 times as large.  Again, this is because the membrane is (radially) "thin".</p><p>(Actually, it's not entirely clear how to use the physical shapes of the compartments and their boundaries to set up the compartments and boundaries of the simulation.)</p><p>Ste5 binding to itself, the setup for oligomerization, is the same in this simulation as in the previous version.</p><hr></hr><h2>Changes</h2><p>One change made in this simulation is the "mini-cell" concept: reducing the volume of the cell and its populations to the point that the membrane compartments are not usually so highly populated.  That goal, at least, seems to have been achieved.  In this simulation, we have reduced the cell's linear size by a factor of 2, and therefore reduced its volume by a factor of 8.</p><p>Another change was generally to make parameters more realistic.  Populations are derived from K. Benjamin's early quantitative Western numbers by dividing them by the "mini-cell" factor.  Molecular weights are all from the database.  The setup calculations and units conversions are all done in a perl script, <a href="./mini-yeast.pl">mini-yeast.pl</a>, the output of which you see <a href="./mini-yeast.out">here.</a></p><p>The new number that seems to have made the most difference was the new diffusion rate for the membrane, roughly 100 times slower than in the cytoplasm.  Alpha factor just sat there in the membrane compartment where it was introduced, and the simulation essentially did not "get off the ground."  </p><hr></hr><p><a href="./source.html">simulation input</a></p><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/alpha.png"></img><p>Alpha factor just sat there in compartment 0, where it was introduced; here we see where it has bound to Ste2.  Otherwise, only a few receptor molecules in adjacent membrane compartments seem to have been touched.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/four-five-total.png"></img><p>Very little translocation happened, apparently because of insufficient activation.  Here, we see that Ste5 hardly ever binds to Ste4.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/four.png"></img><p>Here, we see that a little activation does happen after time 2, when pheromone is added; some Gpa1 apparently does nucleotide exchange and unbinds from Ste4.  Compare with <a href="#gpa1">gpa1.dmp</a> below.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-total.png"></img><p>Ste5 dimerization and oligomerization (that is, how Ste5 binds to itself via either of two binding sites) is set up the same as in the last simulation.</p><p>The "core" compartment is not included in the "cytoplasm" traces, which accounts for the asymmetry here.</p><p>I think that this general movement of Ste5 OUT of the membrane can be accounted for as equilibration.  Starting with a single molecule of Ste5 in each membrane compartment puts the membrane as a whole at slightly higher than average concentration.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-total-membranes.png"></img><p>Ste5-containing molecules in the membrane compartments.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-five-membranes.png"></img><p>Ste5-dimer containing molecules in the membrane compartments.</p><p>In this simulation, corresponding binding sites on Ste5 can bind each other when either of the Ste5's are bound to Ste4.  The stronger binding that was present in version 3 when both of the Ste5 partners were Ste4-bound is now present when either of the Ste5 partners is Ste4-bound.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-five-membranes-sec4-4.5.png"></img><p>Time detail of Ste5-dimer containing molecules in all membrane compartments.  </p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-five-membranes-sec4-4.5-cols.png"></img><p>Time detail of Ste5-dimer containing molecules in a couple of membrane compartments.  </p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-center.png"></img><p>Ste5-containing molecules in the central core.</p><hr></hr><a name="gpa1"></a><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/gpa1.png"></img><p>Gpa1 binding to GDP and GTP.</p></body></html>
