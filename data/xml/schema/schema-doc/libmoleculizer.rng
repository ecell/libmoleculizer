You can see that a moleculizer-input document consists of three main sections, corresponding to the three child elements of the top-level moleculizer-input element.  Follow the child links below to begin exploring the hierarchical structure of a moleculizer-input file.</doc><element name="model"><doc>The model section is where almost all the biology goes, including all species and reactions that you define.  But rather than species or reactions, most of what actually goes here is really reaction generators and building-blocks for species.  For example, the typical way you enter information about a monomeric protein is as a building block for protein complexes.  Similarly, the typical way you enter a binding rate between two proteins is in a generator for dimerization and decomposition reactions between complexes that contain the two proteins.</doc><ref name="optional-user-doc"></ref><ref name="unit-model-content"></ref><element name="reaction-gens"><doc>Reaction generators are defined in this section.  A reaction generator "listens" for the creation of new species that have features that the reaction generator is interested in; that is, features that make the new species a possible substrate for a reaction that the generator might make.  For example, a decomposition generator "listens" for new species containing a specific binding.  The decomposition generator knows about the rate of decomposition of this binding, which it usually assumes to be independent of the rest of the complex.  When it hears of such a new species, it creates a new decomposition reaction that breaks down the binding, potentially producing one or two new species. If a product species is new, then this whole "listening" thing happens when the reaction happens for the first time.</doc><zeroOrMore><ref name="reaction-gens-content"></ref></zeroOrMore></element><element name="explicit-species"><doc>Here you describe species explicitly because you want to create molecules of the species at some point during the simulation, because you want to track the population of the species through the simulation, or because you want to define explict reactions involving the species.  Some things that you might think would be explicit species, such as a monomeric protein, may not be; rather, they are constituents of species of complexes.  (The monomeric protein is a "mol" but you can define an explicit plex-species that contains just the one mol.)</doc><zeroOrMore><ref name="explicit-species-content"></ref></zeroOrMore></element><element name="explicit-reactions"><doc>Most of the reactions that Moleculizer works with are generated automatically by reaction generators, but you can enter reactions one-at-a-time, too.  The participants in an explicit reaction have to be explicit species, so that they have names and you therefore have a way to refer to them in the explicit reaction's definition.</doc><zeroOrMore><element name="reaction"><doc>This is for defining an explicit reaction in stoichiometric, or "high-school-chemistry" format, by giving the names of (explicit) substrate species, along with their multiplicities, and similarly giving the names of (explicit) product species, along with their multiplicities.  Finally, you give the reaction rate.  Note that there is no enforcement of conservation of mass or any other such sanity checks.  Every reaction should have at least one substrate</doc><ref name="optional-user-doc"></ref><zeroOrMore><element name="substrate-species-ref"><doc>Here, you give specify an (explicit) susbstrate species for the reaction.

The units of reaction rate depends on the total multiplicity of the substrates: unary reaction rates are in (Hz), binary reaction rates in (Hz)(l)/(mol).</doc><attribute name="value"><doc user-variable="yes">This should be a non-negative floating-point number, like 34.5, or 9.1e20, or 0.0.</doc></attribute></element></element></zeroOrMore></element><element name="volume"><doc>Give the reaction volume in liters; typically the volume of the cell.

This is a surprisingly common need; for example, to get the total amount of Ste4 that is bound to Ste5, one has to specify all the species that contain the Ste4-Ste5 subcomplex.  This can be done with an omni-species-stream.</doc><zeroOrMore><ref name="species-streams-content"></ref></zeroOrMore></element><element name="dump-streams"><doc>Each dump-stream specifies the contents of a dump file, which is also usually what ends up in a single plot.  Any dumpable item can be dumped in any number of dump files.</doc><zeroOrMore><element name="dump-stream"><doc>A dump-stream specifies what gets dumped into a particular output file.  Each item (explicit-species, species-stream, or simulator statistic) you specify for dumping becomes a column of figures in the dump file. My usual practice is to plot everything in a dump file on a single plot, and the Gnuplot script "plt" that comes with Moleculizer is designed to do this.</doc><attribute name="dump-period"><doc user-variable="yes">The interval in (simulated) seconds between dumps.  This should be a positive, floating-point number, like 52.0 or 0.05.  Typically, all the dump-streams you specify will have the same dump-period, but it is not required that they do.  You could dump statistics more slowly, for example.</doc></attribute><ref name="optional-user-doc"></ref><choice><element name="target-file"><doc>The name of the dump file.  It is also displayed automatically as the title on a plot produced with "plt" if no other title is demanded.</doc><attribute name="file-name"><doc>Usually, you want dump files to end up in the same directory where the simulation is running, so you just give a simple file name, like "kinase-species".

"simulation-output/kinase-species" or "/home/jerry/sims/output/saturday/kinase-species".</doc></attribute></element><element name="target-output-stream"><doc>Use this, instead of a target-file, to dump output to standard output or standard error.

You have to specify a particular species, which must therefore be an explicit-species.

The state dump contains all the species and reactions that exist at the time of the dump, along with other data needed to reconstruct the simulation.  You can continue the simulation from the point where state is dumped using the version of Moleculizer called "continuator," and you can consistently revise the reaction parameters in a state dump using the version of Moleculizer called "parametrizer."
