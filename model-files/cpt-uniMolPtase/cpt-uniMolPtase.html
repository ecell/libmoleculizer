Here, the generator makes a binary reaction between the phosphatase and its substrate, leaving the phosphatase unchanged.  The reaction is, of course, dependent on the substrate's being phosphorylated.</p><hr></hr><p><a href="./source.html">simulation input</a></p><img alt="nothing at ./cpt-uniMolPtase.out/species.png" src="./cpt-uniMolPtase.out/species.png"></img><p>The kinase is introduced at time 1, initiating accumulation of the phosphorylated substrate.  At time 2 sec., the phosphatase is introduced, causing the amount of phosphorylated substrate to drop off.</p></body></html>
