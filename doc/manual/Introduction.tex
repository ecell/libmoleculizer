\section{Overview of Libmoleculizer}
Libmoleculizer is a computer program for explicitly generating species
and reaction networks for intracellular biochemical systems using
rules that describe monomerical proteins and other basic
components, as well as specifications for binding, unbinding, and
other classes of reactions between them.  

Libmoleculizer is intended to be used as component of a larger
cellular simulator, and is typically used in either one of two ways.
The first is as a component in a ``collision-event'' type simulator.
