1. Update the reaction write-outs to make use of moleculizer's new bound-site structural queries.

2. Get this thing handling molecule synthesis/degradation reactions.

3. Fix saturation kinetics bits.  This is currently VERY broken.

4. Handle the "BadReactions" -- see reactionrulesinterpreter.py and util.classifyReaction()
