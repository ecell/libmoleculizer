This directory contains several different programs.

bngl_mzr_convertor - Contains the programs bngl2xml and xml2bngl,
                     which convert .bngl files to intermediate form
                     mzr-xml files in either direction. 

c_interface_demo   - This directory shows of a simple network
                     expander, whose main purpose is to demonstrate
                     how the libmoleculizer C bindings are used.

mzr_xml_convertor  - This program converts a human readable mzr file
                     to a libmoleculizer intermediate form xml file
                     and back again.

mzrnetworkgenerator- This program is a network generator that uses the
                     libmoleculizer engine.  It takes either mzr files
                     or xml files, and takes a wide variety of options
                     as to how the network can be expanded.  It can
                     output data in a libmoleculizer xml output
                     format or SBML.

network_simplifier - The very early stages of a program whose goal is
                     to take a very large network and simplify it down
                     to a "representative network" of a smaller size -
                     essentially attemting to find a best
                     representations in a fixed number of differential
                     equations of a much larger network.

particle_sim_integration_demo  
                   - This is a very basic particle which demonstrates
                     how libmoleculizer can be integrated into a
                     particle based simulator.

ssa_integration_demo - This is a very basic ssa simulator which
                       demonstrates how libmoleculizer can be
                       integrated into a particle based simulator.
