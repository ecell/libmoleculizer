The generated reactions can change any one small-mol component of the omniplex into another small-mol, if desired.  The generated reactions can change the modification at any one modification site on any one mod-mol component of the omniplex, if desired.  The generated reactions can be binary, if desired, requiring any explicit reactant species as a co-reactant with the species that is recognized as containing the omniplex. The generated reactions can produce an arbitrary explicit product species, in addition to the transformed primary reactant, if desired.  Each of these separate activities on the part of the generated reactions is engaged simply by including the appropriate optional elements in this reaction generator specification.</doc><element name="enabling-omniplex"><doc>In this element, you specify a subcomplex which, if recognized in a new species of complex, will cause this reaction generator to make a reaction with the new species of complex as a substrate, possibly along with another substrate given explicitly.</doc><ref name="omni-plex-class"></ref></element><element name="small-mol-exchanges"><doc>This element may contain optional small-molecule-exchange elements to change one small-mol component of a complex for another small-mol.  So, if nucleotide binding is modeled using small-mols, this section could be used to arrange that, in a kinase reaction, an ATP small-mol component is exchanged for an ADP small-mol.  Hydrolysis of a bound small-mol representing a nucleotide is the same; it's the same as a kinase reaction, except that no phosphate modification is added.</doc><zeroOrMore><element name="small-mol-exchange"><doc>This OPTIONAL element lets you specify that a small-mol component of omniplex should be converted into another small-mol when the reaction occurs.  For a kinase, use this option to convert an ATP small-mol instance to ADP.  Similarly, for a g-protein hydrolysis reaction, use this option to convert a GTP small-mol instance to GDP.</doc><element name="small-mol-instance-ref"><doc>Here, you specify the small-mol instance in your enabling complex that you want to be exchanged for another small mol when the reaction occurs.  For example, this would be the ATP instance in a kinase, and it would be exchanged for ADP.  In a g-protein hydrolysis reaction, this would be the GTP instance, and it would be exchanged for GDP.</doc><attribute name="name"><doc>This must be the instance name of a small-mol in your enabling complex.</doc></attribute></element><element name="small-mol-ref"><doc>Here, you specify the small-mol that you want to replace the small-mol instance you gave in the accompanying small-mol-instance-ref.  For a kinase reaction, this would be ADP, which would replace ATP.  For the auto-hydrolysis reaction of a g-protein, this would be GDP, replacing GTP.</doc><attribute name="name"><doc>This must be the name of a small-mol.</doc></attribute></element></element></zeroOrMore></element><element name="modification-exchanges"><doc>This element may contain optional modification-exchange elements to cause modifications to be changed by the generated reactions.  This mechanism could be used to generate kinase reactions by exchanging the "phosphorylated" modification for the "none" modification.  But it could also be used to generated phosphatase reactions by exchanging the "none" modification for the "phophorylated" modification.</doc><zeroOrMore><element name="modification-exchange"><doc>This OPTIONAL element allows you to specify that the modification appearing at a particular modification site in the enabling omniplex will be replaced by another modification when the generated reaction occurs.  For example, in a kinase reaction, you would give the site to be phosphorylated, along with the "phosphorylated" modification to be installed there.  In a phosphatase reaction, you would give the site to be dephosphorylated, along with the "none" modification to be installed there.</doc><element name="mod-mol-instance-ref"><doc>Here, you point out a mod-mol instance, along with a modification site on that mod-mol instance, for substitution by another modification, which you give in the accompanying "installed-mod-ref" element.  Note that, if you wish the reaction only to replace one particular modification, such as "phosphorylated" or "none," then that modifcation must be specified in the instance-states part of the enabling omniplex.  Otherwise, any any modification that appears at this modification site will be substituted by the reaction.</doc><attribute name="name"><doc>This must be the name of a mod-mol instance in the enabling complex.</doc></attribute><element name="mod-site-ref"><doc>Here, you tell which modification site on the substrate mod-mol is to have its modification exchanged for another by the generated reaction..</doc><attribute name="name"><doc>This must be the name of a modification site on the substrate mod-mol.</doc></attribute></element></element><element name="installed-mod-ref"><doc>Here, you specify the modification that you want to be installed at the modification site specified in the accompanying mod-mol-instance-ref element.</doc><attribute name="name"><doc>This must be the name of a modification.</doc></attribute></element></element></zeroOrMore></element><optional><element name="additional-reactant-species"><doc>This OPTIONAL element allows you to specify another reactant species for the generated reactions, so that the generated reactions will be binary.
