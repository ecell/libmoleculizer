  \brief Defines a linear-congruential hash function class. 

  I don't think the hash functions given in our STL implementation
  look particularly promising.  Ints, chars, etc all hash to
  themselves, for example.  If I try to hash addresses, they'll all
  come out multiples of 4.  */

    This really could just as well, maybe better, have been a global
    function.

    \todo Use overloading to handle common types transparently.
    Make provision (another class?) to do accumulation of hash values.
    This provision could be used in the "common types" code.
