The sizes of all the channels connecting compartments are independently user-settable, and they determine the rate at which molecules diffuse from compartment to compartment, together with the diffusion rates of the molecular species.</p><p>Diffusion rates are extrapolated like reaction rates in Moleculizer: the basis of Moleculizer's reaction rate extrapolation is the effect of mass on diffusion.</p><p>Compartmentalizer differs algorithmically from Moleculizer, too.  It does not use a single queue to hold all pending events.  Instead, it uses a version of Gillespie's direct method, which involves sampling the distribution of reaction propensities to determine the type of the next reaction event.  Cptzr implements some minor optimizations of this process.</p><hr></hr><center><img alt="Where is cptzr-flowchart.jpg?" src="cptzr-flowchart.jpg"></img><h2>Flowchart of cptzr algorithm</h2></center></body></html>
