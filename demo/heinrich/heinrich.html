This abstract pathway was the subject of the paper "Mathematical Models of Protein Kinase Signal Transduction," by Heinrich, Neel, and Rapoport.  Molecular Cell 9, 957-970,2002.  </p><hr></hr><p>This plot shows the step-wise activation of the kinase cascade.</p><img alt="Demo not run yet." src="heinrich.out/active-kinases.png"></img><p>This plot shows the unbinding of the ligand from the receptor, along with the constant level of phosphatase.  The phosphatase works to dephosphorylate all the activated protein kinases.</p><img alt="Demo not run yet." src="heinrich.out/others.png"></img></body></html>
