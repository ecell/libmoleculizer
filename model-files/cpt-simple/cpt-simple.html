There are three compartments, alpha, beta, and gamma, all in a row.  All the A reactant starts in compartment alpha, and all the B reactant starts in compartment gamma.  Thus, for A and B to dimerize, they must both diffuse out of their compartments.  Toward the end of the simulation, the center compartment, beta, still contains more of the AB dimer than the outside compartments.</p><hr></hr><p><a href="./source.html">simulation input</a></p><img alt="Nothing at cpt-simple.out/a-compartments.png" src="cpt-simple.out/a-compartments.png"></img><img alt="nothing at cpt-simple.out/b-compartments.png" src="cpt-simple.out/b-compartments.png"></img><img alt="nothing at cpt-simple.out/ab-compartments.png" src="cpt-simple.out/ab-compartments.png"></img></body></html>
