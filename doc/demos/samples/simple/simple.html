  <h1>simple demo</h1>

  <hr />

  <p>This demo shows a simple dimerization-decompostion reaction system;
    three species and two reactions.</p>

  <p>This version of the demo is the "normal" moleculizer way of doing
    this, so that the dimerization forms a complex with two components,
    and the decomposition breaks up the complex into its two
    constituents.</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>One plot shows all the species in this simple simulation.</p>
