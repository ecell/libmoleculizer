This simulation also uses the (correct?) structure of the receptor complex, in which Ste2 binds to Gpa1, instead of to Ste4.</p><p>The compartment structure looks like this:</p><img alt="compartment structure image" src="compartments.png"></img><hr></hr><p><a href="source.html">simulation input</a></p><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor10.out/alpha.png"></img><p>Unfortunately, it's not obvious from this plot that all the alpha factor goes into compartment 0 at time 2.  But the numerical dump file alpha.dmp does show this clearly.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor10.out/five-total.png"></img><p> In this simulation, Ste5 can dimerize with itself when either of the two Ste5's are bound to Ste4.  Ste5-Ste5 binding is further enhanced when both of the Ste5's are bound to Ste4.</p><p>Compared to the other simulations, the diffusion rate of Ste5 has been set very low, to be able to monitor the movements of Ste5-Ste5 dimers in the membrane.  This probably accounts at least in part for the slower movement of Ste5 to the membrane seen here.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor10.out/five-total-membranes.png"></img><p>Ste5-containing molecules in the membrane compartments.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor10.out/five-five-membranes.png"></img><p>Ste5-dimer containing molecules in the membrane compartments.  In this simulation, Ste5 can bind Ste5 when either of the Ste5's are bound to Ste4.  An already-formed Ste5-Ste5 binding will break at a moderate rate as long as one of the partners remains bound to Ste4. When both partners in an existing Ste5-Ste5 dimer become unbound from Ste4, the Ste5-Ste5 binding breaks rapidly.  Ste5-Ste5 binding is faster when both partners are bound to Ste4, and unbinding is somewhat slower, than when only one of the partners is Ste4-bound.</p><p>In this simulation, the binding of Ste5 to Ste5 has been enhanced overall relative to version 3, so that Ste5-Ste5 dimers are more persistent.  This is to make it easier to see diffusion of Ste5-Ste5 dimers in the membrane.</p><p>One concern was whether the apparent "residence time" in this plot was real or an artifact of either the 0.01 sec. dump interval or the 0.01 sec. maximum diffusion time step.  In this simulation, the maximum diffusion time step was reduced by a factor of 10 to 0.001 sec, and another dump file five-five-membranes-fast.dmp was generated with dumping twice as fast, every 0.005 sec.  The ordinary dump file and the "fast" dump file appear the same when plotted, so it seems reasonable to think that the apparent "residence time" in this and following plots is real.</p><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor10.out/five-five-membranes-fast.png"></img><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor10.out/five-five-membranes-sec4-4.5.png"></img><p>Time detail of Ste5-dimer containing molecules in all membrane compartments.  </p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor10.out/five-five-membranes-sec4-4.5-cols.png"></img><p>Time detail of Ste5-dimer containing molecules in a couple of membrane compartments.  </p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor10.out/five-center.png"></img><p>Ste5-containing molecules in the central core.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor10.out/gpa1.png"></img><p>Gpa1 binding to GDP and GTP.</p></body></html>
