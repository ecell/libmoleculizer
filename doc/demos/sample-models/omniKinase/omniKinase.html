The kinase X is introduced at time 1 in unphosphorylated form, and it binds to most of the substrate, but no phosphorylation of the substrate takes place.  At time 2, more kinase X is added, but in phosphorylated form.  Now, the substrate gets phosphorylated, as the rising red line shows.</p><hr></hr><img alt="nothing at omniKinase.out/species.png" src="omniKinase.out/species.png"></img></body></html>
