Eventually it will hold a complete reference for the interface to
mzr::moleculizer, fnd::ReactionNetworkCatalog, and the c-interface to
libmoleculizer.



\subsection{The C Interface}
The c interface to libmoleculizer allows users of the C Programming
language access to the species and reaction capabilities.  Because
this is an interface written in C which is entirely distinct from the
standard C++ interface, it's structure and usage is entirely different
than the typical interface, although its capabilities are similar.  

This interface is used in a C program by including the
``mzr/libmzr_c_interface.h'' file.  The c interface works by creating
a pointer to an object of type moleculizer, and by passing this
pointer along with other parameters into functions which replicate the
major features of a libmoleculizer object in the c++ interface.

To begin, call the
