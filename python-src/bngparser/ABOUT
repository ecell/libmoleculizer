This project is to come up with a parser that will input a BioNetGen
model file and will return a Moleculizer model file.  This should be
quite useful for at least 3 reasons.

1.  It would be useful for the alpha wiki modeling efforts.
    Currently, because of the way that experimentation on this system
    is perfomed, the alpha pathway is modeled in more of a raw form
    that maps more directly to a BNG file.  However, I beleive that
    the more geometric information required by Moleculizer can be
    generated from this information.  This program would therefore
    allow them to use both these programs for the price of one.

2.  It will be useful for E-Cell/Moleculizer integration.  E-Cell will
    be using the Moleculizer engine, but at the current moment, it
    would undoubtably be better for E-Cell to use a more
    human-readable format that is converted into Moelculizer format.
    This can perhaps be used as the basis for that work.

3.  SBML is coming up.  Currently I am not 100% sure of all of the
    ramifications between the different modeling systems.  Hopefully
    this will help make many of these issues clear to me.

To run, type make.
