>xmloperator is an XML editor, a tool that allows you to create, read, and modify documents in XML format. Main features of the tool are the following :</p><ul
><li
>It displays exclusively a tree view of your document,</li><li
>Editing is guided by any DTD (Document Type Definition) or RELAX NG schema.</li></ul><p
>According to these features, it is suited for editing small to large, data oriented, documents, using a large variety of schemas.</p><p

><a id="load" name="load" shape="rect"
>To load a document</a></h3><p
>A document is loaded by an <a href="#instances" shape="rect"
>instance of the tool</a>. You can open several documents in the same time by opening several instances of the tool.</p><p
>You can load a document from your local disk or from a standard URL. In the first case, use the <i
>File / Open document / Browse...</i> menu item (shortkey is Alt-O). In the second case, use the <i
>File / Open document / Enter</i> menu item.</p><p
>After validating loading the document will start. You will be able to follow the following steps of the loading process in the message bar :</p><ol
><li
>Each entity required by the document is loaded.</li><li
>The tree view of the document is displayed. Nodes at the lowest level are expanded.</li><li
>The schema associated to the document type is loaded.</li><li
>IDs and IDREF(S)s are scanned and memorized for later quick reference.</li></ol><h3
><a id="navigate" name="navigate" shape="rect"
>To navigate a document</a></h3><p
>You have a <a href="#tree_view" shape="rect"
>tree view</a> of the opened document. This view corresponds to the Document Object Model of the W3C. At one time, you can select one or more nodes. When only one node is selected (this is the most common case), information relative to the selected node is displayed in the <a href="#detail_view" shape="rect"
>detail view</a>.</p><p
>There may be a lot of nodes in your document, then you need some mechanisms for finding them. The most common method to find a node is by content : you know some fragment of a text node or an attribute value. You can then use the "<a href="#search" shape="rect"
>View / Search...</a>" menu item (shortkey is Ctrl+F) to find the node(s) from its (or their) content. For a more sophisticated criterion, you can use the "<a href="#evaluate" shape="rect"
>View / Evaluate...</a>" menu item (shortkey is Ctrl+Shift+E) which uses a XPath expression.</p><p
><a id="id_navigation" name="id_navigation" shape="rect"
></a>This tool supports also <b
>ID navigation</b>, based on any DTD or any RELAG NG schema that conforms to the DTD compatibility specification. Suppose you have selected an element that has a non-empty IDREF attribute. You can double-click on the attribute or use the <i
>goto</i> menu item from the contextual menu (obtained by right mouse click on the element in the tree view) to select the target element, which has an ID attribute with the same value.</p><p
>Another thing is to remember some nodes you have selected before. You can do that by double clicking on nodes that you want remember. Their are added on the navigation list, accessible through the "<a href="#navigation" shape="rect"
>View / Browsing</a>" menu item.</p><h3
><a id="modify_text_or_attribute_value" name="modify_text_or_attribute_value" shape="rect"
>To modify text or attribute values</a></h3><p
>Once your document <a href="#load" shape="rect"
>loaded</a>, you can modify text and attribute values after selecting them.</p><p
>For a text node, the text value is display both as a line in the tree view and as an editing area in the detail view. The tree view line is truncated and doesn't support editing. Editing occurs in the editing area where the text is fully accessible. You place your cursor at the location you desire and write your text. Your change is stored without you need to do an action for that. The text on the tree view is continually updated.</p><p
>For an attribute, you have to select it in the attribute table of the element detail view. Then, if it is CDATA, you edit it, like for a text node, by placing your cursor somewhere in the value field and writing your value. No validation is required in this case. This is different for an ID, IDREF or IDREFS attribute. A button then occupies the value field. The button action opens a dialog window. For an ID, you enter the value and validate. For an IDREF or IDREFS attributes, you select the referenced element(s). For an enumeration, the value selection occurs directly in the attribute value field. Using ID, IDREF, IDREFS and enumeration works as well with a RELAX NG schema than with a DTD.</p><p
><a id="save_or_not_save" name="save_or_not_save" shape="rect"
></a>Once you have realized some changes on your document, you should <b
>save</b> it. You can use the <i
>File / Save document</i> menu item. Shortkey is Ctrl+S. If you forget to do that and close the document or the tool without saving the document, there will be no message to prevent you to do so. When you will reload the document, may be by re-launching the tool, you will have the surprise, after the loading of your document, to be proposed the execution of some operations. They correspond to the changes you forgot to save before closing the document. By accepting the operations, you apply your changes. By rejecting them you cancel your changes and will not be able any more to recover them. So, if you don't know what to do, the best is to accept the changes since you will be able to undo them later.</p><h3
><a id="add_and_remove_nodes" name="add_and_remove_nodes" shape="rect"
>To add and remove nodes</a></h3><p
>For adding or removing a node in your document you can use the contextual menu (right click on the context node in the tree view), the <a href="#edit_menu" shape="rect"
>Edit menu</a>, or a shortkey.</p><p
>You can select a node (the context node) for inserting a node <b
>before</b> it (shortkey is Ctrl+P) or <b
>after</b> it (shortkey is Ctrl+N). The choice of the context node is not indifferent since it is generally used as pattern for the new node. If the context node is a text node then a text node will be inserted. It would be the same for cdata section node, comment node or processing instruction node. If the context node is an element and if the schema of the document allows the element to be repeated then an element with the same name than the context element is inserted elsewhere a list of possible names for the new element is proposed. If the list contains an only name then an element with that name is immediately inserted.</p><p
>You can also add a <b
>descendant</b> to an element. The shortkey is Ctrl+D. If the element has already descendants then it will be the last. If the element accept text node as descendant then a text node will be added else an element will be added. You will select the element name from a list of possible names or an element will be immediately added if there is only one possible element name.</p><p
>Adding an element (from sibling or parent) may require adding more elements in order to maintain the document validity. The tool manages this aspect by proposing recursively to insert an element at each place where it is missing. At each time, you have to select an element name if there are several possible element names. When only one element name is possible then the element is inserted immediately. If you cancel some element name selection then the document will be kept in an invalid state. It's not a problem since you can <a href="#save_or_not_save" shape="rect"
>save</a> an invalid document and make corrections later.</p><p
><b
>Removing</b> a node requires selecting it and asks for remove. The shortkey is Ctrl+Delete. The operation is not allowed if the element removing would make the element sequence invalid. In that case, you could have to select several nodes or to use the "<a href="#edit_mode_indicator" shape="rect"
>Lazy</a>" mode. By using the lazy mode you make the choice to make temporally the document invalid.</p><p
><b
>Replacing</b> a node is equivalent to removing the node and inserting another node at the same place. If you want to change the node type of your node to another node type than element type then select this node type in the node type field of the detail view. Elsewhere, for changing to element type then use the <i
>Edit / Replace</i> menu item. The shortkey is Ctrl+R. If an element is replaced by another element then the descendants, if any, are kept.</p><h3
><a id="add_and_remove_attributes" name="add_and_remove_attributes" shape="rect"
>To add and remove attributes</a></h3><p
>For adding an attribute to a selected document of your document you can use the <i
>New attribute</i> menu item of the context  menu (right click on the table attribute header) or the one of the <a href="#edit_menu" shape="rect"
>Edit menu</a> or the shortkey Ctrl+U. This action opens a dialog window for selecting an attribute name. Names of attribute already in the element are excluded.</p><p
>For removing an attribute from an element that you have selected in your document you have to select the attribute and ask for removing. You can either use the <i
>Remove attribute</i> menu item of the contextual menu (right click on the attribute name or value in the attribute table) or the one of the Edit menu or the shortkey Alt+Delete. The operation will be not allowed if the attribute is required.</p><h3
><a id="move_nodes" name="move_nodes" shape="rect"
>To move nodes</a></h3><p
>You can move one or more nodes at a time. Moving several nodes require they have the same parent node. Once you have selected your node(s) you can execute moves using one or two step(s).</p><p
>A one step move is a local move. The following operations are proposed by the <a href="#move_menu" shape="rect"
>Move menu</a> and the contextual menu (right click on one selected node).</p><table border="1" frame="border"

>To copy nodes</a></h3><p
>For copying a node (or a sequence of nodes from the same parent node) from one document to the same document or to another document, the tool uses "<b

><a id="create_document" name="create_document" shape="rect"
>To create a new document</a></h3><p
>For creating a new document, use the <i
>Document / new document</i> menu item. This action opens a dialog window, titled "New document", asking you for a <a href="#document_types" shape="rect"
>document type</a> and a file name.</p><p
>If the document type of your future document is already defined then select it in the list. If it is not then click the <i
>New</i> button at the right of the document type field. This action opens a dialog window for defining a new document type. You have to set the following information :</p><ul
><li
><p
>The <b

><p
>The <b
>additional key</b> is useful for distinguishing two document types using the same document element name. It is optional but greatly recommended.</p></li><li
><p
>You may have to set DTD information or/and RELAX NG information. RELAX NG is more flexible and should be preferred  for editing. But you may need to reference a DTD from your document because, as an example, the document references external entities. When DTD and RELAX NG schema are set in the document type it is assumed that this is the RELAX NG schema which drives editing. See details on <a href="#use_dtd" shape="rect"
>using DTDs</a> and <a href="#use_relaxng" shape="rect"
>using RELAX NG</a>.</p></li><li
><p
>The <b

><p
>The "<b
>shortcut used for empty elements</b>" flag has only an effect on writing out the document. The only justification of this flag is the bad interpretation of xhtml documents by old browsers.</p></li><li
><p
>The "<b
>default transformer</b>" field allows setting a default <a href="#transformers" shape="rect"
>transformer</a> for the document.</p></li></ul><p
>You enter the file name end validates. A minimal document conforming to the document type is created, saved using the file name and re<a href="#load" shape="rect"
>loaded</a>.</p><h3
><a id="use_dtd" name="use_dtd" shape="rect"
>To use DTDs</a></h3><p
>The following DTD relative information is (optionally) attached to a document type :</p><ul
><li
><p
>The <b
>DTD Public Id</b> is destined to the DOCTYPE node of a new document.</p></li><li
><p
>The <b
>Document relative System Id</b> is destined to the DOCTYPE node of a new document.</p></li><li
><p
>The <b
>HTTP DTD System Id</b> is an absolute URI for referencing the document.</p></li><li
><p
>The <b
>User relative DTD System Id</b> is an URI where the DTD will be accessed for editing.</p></li></ul><p
>In your documents with DTD, you have to choose between a DTD internal subset and a DTD external subset. The reason is this one. Suppose you load a document which has a document type declaration with an internal subset and a reference to an external subset. The tool read a monolithic DTD, making no difference between the DTD internal subset and the external subset. It's cool for editing but when you will save your document the DTD internal subset will be lost.</p><p
>So you have to choose between the two following cases :</p><ul
><li
><p
>Your document refers to an external DTD and contains no internal subset. You have defined the document relative System Id information consistently. You may have defined the DTD Public Id. You may have defined the user relative DTD System Id in order to access it.</p></li><li
><p
>The document type declaration of your document contains a DTD internal subset and doesn't refer to an external subset. The DTD relative document type information is not set. In this case the DTD will be saved with the document, as DTD internal subset.</p></li></ul><p
>If your document has or refers to a DTD and you want to remove completely the document type declaration from it, you can do that by clearing the saving option "DOCTYPE if DTD".</p><p
>You can use a DTD to edit a document without document type declaration. You have simply to set the <i
>User relative DTD System Id</i> and not set the <i
>Document relative DTD System Id</i>. The DTD will be loaded after the document. At some time you might be asked for associating the document to a document type.</p><p
>If your document type information includes the user relative DTD System Id then you have two methods for modifying the DTD : you can edit it as text by using the <i
>Selected type / Edit DTD / as DTD</i> menu item of the <a href="#document_types_window" shape="rect"

><a id="use_relaxng" name="use_relaxng" shape="rect"
>To use RELAX NG</a></h3><p
>The tool offers some RELAX NG support. RELAX NG is used for guiding editing. The tool helps you to make your document valid but it doesn't verify all the constraints that a document must conform to be valid. Also you need an external RELAX NG validation tool for validating your document after editing with this tool.</p><p
>The following RELAX NG relative information is (optionally) attached to a document type :</p><ul
><li
><p
>The <b

><p
>The <b
>RNG simple syntax System Id</b> is an URI where should be available the RELAX NG schema in its simplified form.</p></li></ul><p
>The tool contains a full syntax to simple syntax translator. You can launch the translator by using the <i
>Build</i> button in the RELAG NG panel of the document type dialog (see the <a href="#document_types_window" shape="rect"
>Document types window</a>). The input is the schema referenced by the <i
>RNG full syntax System Id</i>. The output will be referenced by the <i
>RNG simple syntax System Id</i>.</p><p
>Another way to simplify a RELAX NG schema is to load it in a tool window and using the <i
>File / Simplify RELAX NG schema</i> menu. There are three menu items that map to three possible modes of simplification :</p><ul
><li
><p
><b
>Simple syntax</b>. This mode produces the simple syntax as defined by the RELAX NG specification.</p></li><li
><p
><b
>Group with more than two children</b>. Using this mode, all the simplification steps are executed except the §4.12 one that reduces the number of child elements. This is the mode used by the document type dialog.</p></li><li
><p
><b
>Ref resolution only</b>. This mode executes minimal simplification. Its purpose is only to resolve the <i
>externalRef</i> and <i
>include</i> elements before transforming the schema to HTML for being browsed by the user.</p></li></ul><p
>If you load a document associated to a document type whose the <i

><a id="use_dtdxml" name="use_dtdxml" shape="rect"
>To use DTDXML</a></h3><p
>DTDXML is an XML dialect for representing DTDs. By editing a DTDXML document then compiling it to a DTD, you have a best control of the production of DTD. However there is no DTDXML specification, only a DTD. It's not a standard.</p><p

><li
><p
>For editing the DTDXML document, use the <i
>Selected type / Edit DTD / As DTDXML</i> menu item. The document will be loaded in a free tool instance. You will be guided by its DTD for editing.</p></li><li
><p
>For producing the DTD, use the <i

>But what is a transformer ?</p><p
>A transformer is used for translating documents from an XML format to another XML format or to text format. This section considers particularly XSLT transformers. For defining a transformer you have to proceed as follows. First you opens the <a href="#transformers_window" shape="rect"
>Transformers window</a> by using the <i
>Document / Transformers</i> menu item. Then you use the "New" menu item on this window. This action will open a dialog window titled "Transformer" whose you will set the fields in that way :</p><ul
><li
><p
>You have to give a <b
>Name</b> to the transformer.</p></li><li
><p
>You set the <b
>Document type name</b>, which is the name of the source document element. This is used for transformer selecting.</p></li><li
><p
>By clicking the <i
>XSLT</i> button you will set the transformer <i
>Class name</i> to "org.xmloperator.transform.XSLTTransformer", which is the adapter Java class to the Xalan XSLT processor, included to the tool.</p></li><li
><p
>You enter the <b
>Style sheet System Id</b> or action the <i
>Choose</i> button for selecting it by browsing.</p></li><li
><p
>You may have to give the list of <b
>Param names</b> if any. They must be separated by spaces.</p></li><li
><p
>Check the <b
>XML Result</b> box if the transformer must produce an XML document. Don't check for a text output format.</p></li><li
><p
>You enter the destination <i
>DTD Public Id</i> and <i
>DTD System Id</i> of your destination document only if you want to include a document type declaration to it.</p></li><li
><p
>You select the destination document <i
>Encoding name</i>.</p></li><li
><p
>You can specify "<i
>Standalone document</i>" and/or "<i
>Shortcut use for empty element</i>" for the destination document.</p></li></ul><p
>Your transformer is based on a style sheet. For writing such a style sheet by using the tool, you can use the <i
>xsl:stylesheet</i> or the <i
>xsl:transform</i> document type. They use a RELAX NG schema.</p><p
>For debugging your style sheet, there is some XSLT options available. After modifying your style sheet document, you can re-transform your source document by using the <i
>File / Transform document</i> (shortkey is Ctrlr+Shift+V), which uses the same destination document System Id than previously.</p><h3
><a id="compare_documents" name="compare_documents" shape="rect"
>To compare two documents</a></h3><p
>The tool proposes the comparison of documents. The used method consists of associating comparable elements of the two documents. The comparison result doesn't depend on the order of elements. More precisely, elements with the same content but in another order are considered equal. This kind of comparison is usefull and suitable to the tool but you may need an ordered kind of comparison. If so then you should search for an "XML diff" tool on the web.</p><p
>For comparing two documents, you must first loading each document in a separate <a href="#instances" shape="rect"
>tool instance</a>, then using the <i
>Compare / Associate</i> menu item on one of the two instances. The look of each document is changed in that way :</p><ul
><li
><p
>An element identical to an element of the other document keeps its normal font.</p></li><li
><p
>An element that has no mapping element in the other document takes a bold font.</p></li><li
><p
>An element associated to an element of the other document because one or more of its children are associated to children of the other element takes an italic font.</p></li></ul><p
>For selecting in the other document the element associated to an element (rendered by normal or italic font), you can use the <i
>Compare / Associated element</i> menu item or its shortkey Ctrl+Shift+A.</p><p
>You can edit one or the two documents but the comparison will be updated only if you re-launch it (shortkey is Ctrl+Shift+C).</p><p
>By the <i
>Disassociate</i> menu item, you disassociates the two documents. They take again their usual look. Disassociation is automatic if you close one of the two documents.</p><h2

It is only possible to validate if the transformer name is entered.</p><p
><a id="duplicate_transformer" name="duplicate_transformer" shape="rect"
></a>The <b
>Duplicate</b> menu item has the same effect than the New menu item with this difference that the entry fields get the values corresponding to the currently selected transformer.</p><p
><a id="modify_transformer" name="modify_transformer" shape="rect"
></a>The <b
>Modify</b> menu item opens a dialog window allowing the modification of the transformer selected. The dialog window is the same as that which defines a new transformer.</p><p
><a id="remove_transformer" name="remove_transformer" shape="rect"
></a>The <b
>Remove</b> menu item removes the selected transformer.</p><h3
><a id="document_types" name="document_types" shape="rect"
>Document types</a></h3><p
>The tool keeps, for each document type, some relative information.</p><p
>A document type is identified by the document element name and an additional key. If you want use different document element names with the same document type then keep the document element name empty. You can have several document types with the same document element name but with different additional keys. An additional key represents nothing by itself when creating a document.</p><p
>The information attached to a document type includes: the DTD public identifier, the reference HTTP URL of the DTD, the URL of the DTD as it appears in the "DOCTYPE" node of the document, the path to the user DTD, the path to the XML version of the DTD, the RELAX NG full syntax System Id, the RELAX NG simple syntax System Id, the namespace identifier, the flag about using shortcut for empty elements, and the reference transformer name.</p><p
>This information is that which is used during a document save. When the <i
>Document relative DTD System Id</i> is absent then, the document DTD, if any, is inserted directly into the document.</p><h3
><a id="tasks" name="tasks" shape="rect"
>Tasks</a></h3><p
>An action that could use some time is managed as a task. Examples of tasks are : loading a document, saving a document or transforms a document. During a task, all the menus are disabled and the indicators in the status bar are replaced by a <i
>Cancel</i> button.</p><h3
><a id="operations" name="operations" shape="rect"
>Operations</a></h3><p
>An &lt;operation&gt; is any atomic alteration made to a document, realized with the help of the tool. With each action of the tool that results in a change to the document in memory, an operation is created, run and added to a stack of operations. The operations already run can be cancelled. You can undo or redo any operation. The stack of operations can be consulted in the <a href="#operations_window" shape="rect"
>operations window</a>. The operations can be kept for being rerun later in operations files. A special operation, labeled "and", has no effect on the document. This operation joins two operations. It signifies that the operations linked in this way must be considered indissociable, in order to maintain the validity of the document.</p><p
><a id="operations_file" name="operations_file" shape="rect"
></a>A sequence of operation can be saved in an <b
>operations file</b> to be rerun later, in an equivalent context. An operations file has the suffix ".ope". The operations file relative to a document file carry the name of the document file in which the suffix is replaced by ".ope". For this reason, an operations file cannot be attached to an operations file.
Editing an operations file uses a schema called xmloperator_x_y_operations.rng where x and y map to the release x.y.z of the tool.</p><p
>At the conclusion of loading a document, if it exists an operations file attached to it then you will be prompted to rerun the operations it contains. An operation that cannot be run in a given document context will be rejected. You should to choose whether or not to run the subsequent operations.</p><p
><a id="operators" name="operators" shape="rect"
></a>An <b
>operator</b> is an additional code, linked at run-time, implementing a given Java interface and realizing a special (and generally complex) sequence of operations.</p><h3
><a id="transformers" name="transformers" shape="rect"
>Transformers</a></h3><p
>A transformer is used for producing a document from another document. The documents generally have not the same schema or DTD. The tool uses a standard transformer interface. You can create a Java class that implements this interface and dynamically link this class to the tool. You can also write an XSLT stylesheet. The XSLT engine is provided by the Xalan-J software of the Apache Software Foundation.</p><p
>The information attached to a transformer includes : the transformer name, the full Java class name, the style sheet path name for an XSL Transformation and the output format depending information. The output format is either XML document or text. For an XML output, the public identifier and the system identifier of a destination DTD can be defined with the encoding names, the standalone flag and the shortcut enabling flag.</p><h3
><a id="options" name="options" shape="rect"
>Options</a></h3><p
>All the settings of the tool are designated by &lt;options&gt;. Certain options may be modified by using the options dialog, the others can be modified by editing the options document. Options are loaded at tool launching and saved at tool closing.</p><p
><a id="options_file" name="options_file" shape="rect"
></a>The tool <b
>options file</b> is named "xmloperator.xin". The path can be specified as parameter in the command line. If the path is not specified then the file is created in the tool's launch directory. Editing this document uses a schema called "xmloperator_x_y_options.rng" where x and y map to the release x.y.z of the tool.</p><h3
><a id="particularities" name="particularities" shape="rect"
>Particularities</a></h3><p
>The tool defines a <b
>processing instruction target</b>, named <i
>xmloperator</i>, but without case distinction. An <i
>xmloperator</i> processing instruction is supposed to be only interpreted by the xmloperator tool. All other document-processing tools are supposed to ignore this instruction. The tool uses these instructions to attach certain processing options to document instances. An instruction is made up of one or more space separated commands. Only the processing instructions whose parent node is the document element are interpreted. There is only one instruction currently defined : the "ReadOnly" instruction. The "ReadOnly" instruction opens a document in read only mode. This doesn't prevent you from switching immediately to the "Ready" mode and editing the document.</p><h3
><a id="bugs" name="bugs" shape="rect"
>Bugs</a></h3><p
>There will be always bugs. We have simply to reduce their effects and manage their fixing.</p><p
>A bug appears on an unexpected case and generally raises an exception. The exception is intercepted by the tool (but some ones are not) and is reported to you by a persistent message "SEE EXCEPTION TRACE" in the message bar. Then you have to use the <i
>View / Exception trace</i> menu item for reading and accepting the exception. Accepting the exception means only that the "SEE EXCEPTION TRACE" message will be cleared.</p><p
>The exception trace contains the date, the tool version, and the exception(s) that have arisen. Each exception appears as a call stack. For bug fixing, you should send a copy of this trace to the tool developer (info@xmloperator.net). Additional comments would be welcome.</p><hr
