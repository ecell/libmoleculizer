        <element name='target-mod-mol-instance-ref'>
          <doc>Here, you say which protein in the "enabling complex" is actually the G-protein.  You do this by giving the instance name of the protein, which must be a mod-mol, since nucleotide bindings are modeled as modifications.  In the mod-site-ref element, you say which modification site on the mod-mol is involved.  Note that the G-protein (Gpa1) need not be bound to GDP (i.e. have the GDP-bound modification at the correct modification site) to be involved in this form of nucleotide exchange.  (In this it differs from gpa-exchange-gen.)</doc>
