\chapter{Using Libmoleculizer}
Libmoleculizer is a software library that takes a specification of
rules that describe proteins and small molecules as well as rules that
describe protein-protein reactions, enzymatic reactions, protein-small
molecule interactions.  

These rules are provided either in xml format or text file format to
libmoleculizer (Described in the {\bf Rules} chapter) to
libmoleculizer. 

Once rules have been provided to libmoleculizer which describe the
reaction types, there are several ways in which libmoleculizer can be
used to describe the resulting system.
