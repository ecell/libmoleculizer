This figure shows the pattern in which the membrane is divided into patches:</p><center><img alt="compartments.png" src="compartments.png"></img></center><p>There are 16 membrane compartments: first, divide the sphere into octants, with four compartments in each hemisphere.  Now divide the compartments in both the north and south hemispheres in half by adding another "longitude" line. There are 16 cytoplasm compartments directly "beneath" and communicating with the corresponding membrane compartments.  At the center, there is a diffusive "core" that communicates with all 16 cytoplasm compartments.</p><p>Aside from the increase in the number of compartments, the overall setup is close to that in the first "sphere" simulation:  membrane, cytoplasm and the "core" compartments are all the same sizes as before; the membrane compartments are 0.1 times the size cytplasm compartments, and the "core" is the same size as a cytoplasm compartment.</p><p>No attempt was made to cause boundary areas or volumes to correspond to the illustrated physical dimensions, only the arrangement.  Boundaries between the cytoplasm compartments are all the same, and they are the same as those between the cytoplasm compartments and the center compartment.  Boundaries between membrane compartments are 0.1 times the area of the rest of the boundaries, corresponding to the notion that the membrane compartments are 0.1 times as "thick" as the membrane compartments.</p><p>(Actually, it's not entirely clear how to use the physical shapes of the compartments and their boundaries to set up the compartments and boundaries of the simulation.)</p><hr></hr><p><a href="./source.html">simulation input</a></p><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/alpha.png"></img><p>Unfortunately, it's not obvious from this plot that all the alpha factor goes into compartment 0 at time 2.  It's also hard to see it in the .dmp file, now that the membrane compartments are more highly interconnected.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-total.png"></img><p>In this simulation, Ste5 can dimerize with itself when either of the two Ste5's are bound to Ste4.  Ste5-Ste5 binding is further enhanced when both of the Ste5's are bound to Ste4.</p><p>Compared to most of the cpt-receptor10 simulations, the diffusion rate of Ste5 has been set very low, to be able to monitor the movements of Ste5-Ste5 dimers in the membrane.</p><p>Also, like in the cpt-receptor10 simulations, the "core" compartment is not included in the "cytoplasm" traces, which may account for part of the asymmetry here.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-total-membranes.png"></img><p>Ste5-containing molecules in the membrane compartments.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-five-membranes.png"></img><p>Ste5-dimer containing molecules in the membrane compartments.  In this simulation, Ste5 can bind Ste5 when either of the Ste5's are bound to Ste4.  An already-formed Ste5-Ste5 binding will break at a moderate rate as long as one of the partners remains bound to Ste4. When both partners in an existing Ste5-Ste5 dimer become unbound from Ste4, the Ste5-Ste5 binding breaks rapidly.  Ste5-Ste5 binding is faster when both partners are bound to Ste4, and unbinding is somewhat slower, than when only one of the partners is Ste4-bound.</p><p>In this simulation, the binding of Ste5 to Ste5 has been made quite strong, so that Ste5-Ste5 dimers are more persistent.   The diffusion rate of Ste5 has also been made quite low.  Combined, these changes should make it easier to "see" diffusion of Ste5-Ste5 dimers in the membrane.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-five-membranes-sec4-4.5.png"></img><p>Time detail of Ste5-dimer containing molecules in all membrane compartments.  </p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-five-membranes-sec4-4.5-cols.png"></img><p>Time detail of Ste5-dimer containing molecules in a couple of membrane compartments.  </p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/five-center.png"></img><p>Ste5-containing molecules in the central core.</p><hr></hr><img alt="simulation not run yet" src="cpt-receptor-sphere.out/gpa1.png"></img><p>Gpa1 binding to GDP and GTP.</p></body></html>
